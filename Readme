Ubiquiti UniFi External Portal Example
----------------------------------------
The provided example of authorizing guests on the UniFi controller had 
some minor issues. First and for most was the the fact that it relied 
on an external script. This is a deal breaker for users that are on 
cheap shared hosting that has functions PHP's exec disabled for 
security purposes. It also is not a good idea to call out to external 
scripts from the internet at large due to the security implications. 
This is a pure PHP solution and just requires that the curl module is 
installed for PHP.


Files
-----------------------------------------
There are three examples included.
  * Simple is most basic form, this can be used as a jumping off point
    to making your own more complex portal.
  * MySQL contains a way to store uses in an external database
  * MySQL + LDAP is a more complex example. It contains a way to
    authorize a user from either MySQL or LDAP


Installation
-----------------------------------------
For the simple example just edit the index.php file and point it to
your own URL. You will also need to edit config.php and enter in your
unifi controller details.

For the MySQL in addtion to editing index.php you will need to edit
config.php and create a database. See tables.sql for an example table
layout

For MySQL and LDAP edit index.php and config.php entering the
appropriate details. You will also need to create a database like what 
is outlined in the MySQL example.


How it works
-----------------------------------------
The code is pretty straight forward. Index.php redirects to a log in 
page this just makes sure the url looks pretty and is not just a 
confusing looking IP address. Login.php is just a basic form. It 
captures the GET variables passed by the unifi controller and store 
them in PHP session variables. Authorized.php is the heart of the 
authentication. In addition to check for valid users and passwords it 
interacts with the unifi controller API using CURL. Once the CURL post 
is made it sleeps for a short while to give time for the controller to 
authorize the client then redirects the client to their original 
destination.
